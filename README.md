In our given ecommerce sales analysis dashboard, we did a brief analysis for a given 
ecommerce sales dataset for years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 for the segments consumer, 
corporate and home office in the region Central, East, South and West. 
So, in this project first of all we collected our dataset and then organised it according to the 
requirements and then with some formatting and formulas we constructed the pivot charts and 
made an interactive dashboard.
